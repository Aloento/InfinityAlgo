#### ✅ Core Best Practices

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Stick to a written trading plan

Define setups, entry/exit rules, and risk per trade, then follow it religiously.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Risk ≤ 2% of account per trade

Size every position with `risk $ ÷ stop-distance = trade size`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Journal every trade

Log price, thesis, emotion; review weekly to spot repeat mistakes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Keep learning continuously

Markets evolve—read, backtest, and attend webinars each month.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Control your emotions

Fear & greed sabotage analysis—use pre-trade checklists to stay objective.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Avoid over-trading

Quality beats quantity; never revenge trade after a loss.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Respect leverage carefully

It magnifies losses as easily as gains; scale down in volatile markets.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

#### 🚨 Critical Rules (Never Break These)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Always set stop-losses

Automation enforces discipline when price moves fast—no exceptions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Never trade money you can't afford to lose

Capital preservation is Rule #1—rent money is not trading capital.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Never ignore risk management

One bad trade without stops can wipe out months of profits.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

#### 📊 Market Awareness

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Watch the economic calendar

CPI, Fed meetings, and earnings can invalidate technical setups instantly.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Understand your tools & indicators

Backtest each tweak before going live—know your edge.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Diversify assets & strategies

"Many baskets" lower drawdowns and smooth equity curves.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
