# 📋 Settings Spreadsheet

[Got ideas? Request a feature](https://infinityalgo.canny.io/?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=banner)

We don't provide a settings spreadsheet — and that's by design. This page explains why dynamic optimization is superior to static settings.

**TL;DR:** Markets change constantly. Static settings that worked yesterday fail today. Use AI Optimization or develop your own adaptive approach through continuous testing.

## The Static Settings Trap

### Why Spreadsheets Don't Work

The Problem:

* Markets evolve daily
* Volatility changes
* Correlations shift
* Liquidity varies

The False Promise:

* "Best settings for BTCUSDT"
* "Copy my profitable settings"
* "Universal parameters"
* "Set and forget"

### Real Market Example — Bitcoin 2024–2025

January 2024 Settings:

* Sensitivity: 14
* Works great in trending market
* 70% win rate

March 2024 Same Settings:

* Market turns choppy
* 30% win rate
* Account down 20%

Lesson: What worked for 2 months failed completely when conditions changed.

## 🤖 The Solution: Dynamic Optimization

### Static vs Dynamic Comparison

| Static Settings           |              Dynamic AI | Winner |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------: | :----: |
| Fixed parameters          |     Adapts every N bars |  AI ✅  |
| Manual updates            |  Automatic optimization |  AI ✅  |
| Works until it doesn't    |    Continuously evolves |  AI ✅  |
| One-size-fits-all         | Personalized to metrics |  AI ✅  |
| Hope markets don't change |     Responds to changes |  AI ✅  |

## ❓ Common Questions

<details>

<summary>But other indicators provide settings — what's different?</summary>

Most indicators are static tools without AI. They NEED manual settings because they can't adapt.

Infinity Algo V3.0 has AI that makes static settings obsolete. It's like comparing a manual camera (need to set everything) to a modern smartphone (auto-adjusts for perfect shots).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can you just share what's working now?</summary>

What's working NOW:

* For me: Won't work for you (different everything)
* Today: Won't work tomorrow (markets change)
* On BTCUSDT: Won't work on ETHUSDT (different behavior)

Instead: Use AI mode or test yourself weekly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I found profitable settings, should I share?</summary>

Ask yourself:

* How long have they worked?
* In what market conditions?
* What's the sample size?
* What's the maximum drawdown?

If less than 100 trades across different conditions, it's likely luck, not an edge.
