# 📋 Settings Spreadsheet

We don't provide a settings spreadsheet - and that's by design. This page explains why dynamic optimization is superior to static settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**TL;DR:** Markets change constantly. Static settings that worked yesterday fail today. Use AI Optimization or develop your own adaptive approach through continuous testing.

### ❌ The Static Settings Trap

#### Why Spreadsheets Don't Work

{% columns %}
{% column width="50%" %}
**The Problem:**

- Markets evolve daily
- Volatility changes
- Correlations shift
- Liquidity varies
  {% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
**The False Promise:**

- "Best settings for BTCUSDT"
- "Copy my profitable settings"
- "Universal parameters"
- "Set and forget"
  {% endcolumn %}
  {% endcolumns %}

#### Real Market Example

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Case Study: Bitcoin 2024-2025**

**January 2024 Settings:**

- Sensitivity: 14
- Works great in trending market
- 70% win rate

**March 2024 Same Settings:**

- Market turns choppy
- 30% win rate
- Account down 20%

**Lesson:** What worked for 2 months failed completely when conditions changed.

### ❓ Common Questions

<details>

<summary><strong>But other indicators provide settings!</strong></summary>

Most indicators are static tools without AI. They NEED manual settings because they can't adapt.

Infinity Algo V3.0 has AI that makes static settings obsolete. It's like comparing a manual camera (need to set everything) to a modern smartphone (auto-adjusts for perfect shots).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can you just share what's working now?</strong></summary>

What's working NOW:

- **For me:** Won't work for you (different everything)
- **Today:** Won't work tomorrow (markets change)
- **On BTCUSDT:** Won't work on ETHUSDT (different behavior)

Instead: Use AI mode or test yourself weekly.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>I found profitable settings, should I share?</strong></summary>

Ask yourself:

- How long have they worked?
- In what market conditions?
- What's the sample size?
- What's the maximum drawdown?

If less than 100 trades across different conditions, it's luck, not edge.
