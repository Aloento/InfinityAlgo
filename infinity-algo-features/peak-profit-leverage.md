## 🎯 What It Does

📈 Peak Profit Display

🤖 AI Dashboard

### Live Trade Tracking

Shows the highest profit reached since entry, multiplied by leverage.

Example:

* Trade reaches: 2% profit
* Leverage set to: 50x
* Display shows: 100% peak

This helps visualize your maximum potential with leverage.

### Performance Calculation

AI Dashboard uses this to show:

* Simulated Total Profit %
* Simulated Total Profit $

See how AI strategy would perform with your leverage.

### 📊 Visual Examples

## ⚠️ What It DOESN'T Do

Does NOT Include / Why It Matters

* ❌ Compounding — Real trading compounds gains/losses
* ❌ Liquidation risk — High leverage can wipe accounts
* ❌ Fees/slippage — Real costs reduce profits
* ❌ Margin calls — Exchanges close losing positions
* ❌ Signal changes — Entry/exit points stay the same
